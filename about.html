                <p>Well, my name is Nelly! I have been working as a full stack developer for about 10 years. I have been working
                    in a range of biggest to smallest companies in Australia Sydney, Melbourne and overseas with different
                    kind of people.

                <br>

                <p>
                    The fun fact about me is that I enjoy breaking stereotypes revolving around us as developers by keeping the balance between
                    being kind of geeky and living my life. I like developing, playing competitive sport, having road trips,
                    going to the pub, reading book, listening to JJJ;)
