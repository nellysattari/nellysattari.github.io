My weblog used to be hosted in Blogger site. So, it takes me a while to move all my posts to my new weblog on GitHub.
So, you can check out the [Selenium Post] for more info on 
What `Automation Test` is and how to get `Selenium` tool installed and how to provide a framework in `.Net`
solution using `WebDriver` and `c#` code.
