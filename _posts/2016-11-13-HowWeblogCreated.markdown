Using GitHub pages is a nice solution if you are looking for a `personal weblog` for yourself.
You will leverage `Github` as a source control, `GitHub pages` as a static stite hosting service and also `Jekyll` as a popular static site generator.

Using Jekyll, helps you write your blog without being worried about too many `HTML` statements. 
Also there are lots of [Jekyll themes] that you can download and simply use. 

You can only have one personal site at your `gituser.github.io` address and you can definitely assign `CNAME` to the URL to make it more customized. 
 
The posts created by Jekyll are `Markdown` and the content can be a bit of `Liquid template language` 
and a bit of `HTML`. They will be eventually converted to `Html` though when they get build by Jekyll.

# Install Jekyll:
Jekyll is driven by Ruby language so you need to install some stuff on your machine.
It is a bit tricky to install it on the `Windows` but I provide some [links] which can be handy. 

Check out the [Github Docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.
