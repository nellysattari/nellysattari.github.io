Hi there, my name is Nelly. I have been working as a full stack developer for about 10 years in a range of biggest to smallest companies 
in Australia (Sydney and Melbourne) and overseas with different kind of people.

The fun fact about me is that I enjoy breaking stereotypes revolving around us as developers by keeping the balance between
being kind of geeky and living my life. 
Other than developing, I like playing `Beach Volleyball`, `Table Tennis` and `Chest`.
I enjoy road trips, pubs, reading book and listening to JJJ ;)
